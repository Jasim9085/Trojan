    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks-out your repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up JDK 17
      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '17'
          distribution: 'temurin'

      # Step 3: Setup a global Gradle installation (since gradlew is missing)
      # This reads your gradle-wrapper.properties to determine the right version
      - name: Setup Gradle
        uses: gradle/actions/setup-gradle@v3

      # Step 4: Build using the global 'gradle' command
      # This calls 'clean' first to prevent caching issues.
      - name: Build with Gradle
        run: gradle clean assembleDebug

      # Step 5: Upload the build artifact (the APK)
      - name: Upload debug APK
